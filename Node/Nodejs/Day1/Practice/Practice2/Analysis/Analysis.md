==> Timers

You can set a time in three way.
1. setTimeOut
2. zeroDelay
3. setInterval

1. setTimeOut
- Create one function myFunction.
- Use two variable a and b.
- Add two variable a & b and store in c.
- Put that function in setTimeOut.
- So that function goes out at 50 milisecond.

2. zero Delay
- Create one function settime.
- In the settime, add setTimeOut method in which I have print one string.
- setTineout at zero second.
- Outside the setTimeOut methode, print another string.
- Call the function settime.

3. setInterval
- Create one function setinterval. 
- Create the setInterval methode in it.
- Pirnt one string in setInterval method.
- set time of that method at every 2000 milisecond.
- The setinterval method call recursively at every 2000 milisecond.
